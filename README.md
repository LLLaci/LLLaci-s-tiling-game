## Introduction:

This is my first Github project.

I would like to write a JavaScript code that allows me to draw regular tilings (planar, spherical and hyperbolic) on an HTML canvas.

I envision an interactive interface where the shapes drawn can be moved (rotated and translated) by mouse movement and individual tiles can be colored by clicking on them.

Furthermore, I would like to collect the background calculations necessary for the program's creation as well.
