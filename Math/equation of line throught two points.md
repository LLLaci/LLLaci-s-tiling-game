## Equation throught two line

Determining the equation of a line passing through two points is one of the most common problems.

Here is a derivation:

Equation of a line:

①: $ax + by + c = 0$

Let the coordinates be: A( $x_1,y_1$ ) and B ( $x_2,y_2$ )

The line will go throught both poinst:

②: $ax_1 + by_1 + c = 0$

③: $ax_2 + by_2 + c = 0$

②=③: $ax_1 + by_1 + \cancel{\text{c}} = ax_2 + by_2 + \cancel{\text{c}}$

④: $(x_1-x_2)a = (y_2-y_1)b$
